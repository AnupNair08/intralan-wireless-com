# About

NetCon is an `All in One` communication app for file sharing, voice calling, and text messaging
for the users connected to the same WiFi network or over a mobile hot-spot. The app is
completely serverless and uses peer-to-peer connections for all its functions and works without
the Internet. In addition, it is highly secure as data is transmitted in an encrypted format and
stays within the users that have an ongoing connection.
To put it simply, NetCon is fast, secure, and reliable and meets all your communication needs
within a Local Network.

# Why use it?

At present, institutional networks (like colleges) consist of a large number of devices connected
to the same wifi network, but still, use public internet for file transfer, text messaging, and phone
calls requiring high bandwidth and high data consumption.
It is also widely useful for small home networks where devices connected to the same WiFi can
share content without using other Internet-based communication mediums.
This app connects devices in the same network (connected to the same WiFi or mobile hotspot).
Once connected, the users can seamlessly transfer files of any size, voice call, and send text
messages to other users without using the public Internet. Since no public internet is involved,
data transfer occurs at a faster rate. Also, all the data is transferred securely in encrypted form.


# How To Use?


Launch the app and enter your name (required), Email ID, and Contact Number (optional). You
will be provided a Unique Peer Id.

1. Move to `Settings Tab` and turn ON `Network Discovery`.You will receive a welcoming
message thereafter. This starts broadcasting your Peer Id and other information in the
network so that other devices can discover and connect to you.

2. Move to `Connections Tab` and tap the search button. This will start searching for
discoverable connections in the network and list the users. Tap on `Stop Search` after
you see other users listed.

3. Tap on the User you want to connect to and select from any one of the 3 options - Call,
Chat, or File Transfer.

4. It will then initiate a peer connection with the user and perform the desired action.Please note that `Network Discovery` should be turned ON in the Settings Tab on the device you want to discover in the network.


You can always turn OFF network discovery in the `Settings Tab` to save battery. After this,
other users cannot discover and connect to you in the network.

In addition to that, if the `Network Discovery` settings are not working as expected, the user can
reset those settings in the `Settings Tab`.


# Features

1. Works without Internet.
2. Transfer files of any size at a decent speed.
3. High-quality voice calls.
4. Decentralized messaging.
5. Chats and Call History saved locally on the device.

# Security and Privacy

The app, being completely serverless, stores all the information on the mobile device. The user
can choose to be anonymous and optionally provide an Email and Contact Number in the Login
Screen. The app doesnâ€™t mandate it.

The user can turn ON/OFF his/her discovery in the WiFi network in the `Settings Tab`. By
turning ON network discovery, the user gives consent to broadcast Peer Id in the network along
with other information like username, email, and contact number (if provided while login).
Turning OFF discovery will stop broadcasting the information and hence making users
non-discoverable. Thus, the user has complete control over the broadcast.

Other users can only connect if network discovery is turned ON. In addition to that, features like
File Transfer require user permission, thus anyone in the network cannot send content without
user permission. This also extends to phone calls which commence only on user approval.

All the call logs and chats are stored within the app on the device and never transferred
anywhere over the network. Received files are stored within a new folder `NetCon` within the
Downloads folder of the device.File transfer and other communication between devices take place with the help of peer-to-peer
connection between devices and using web sockets. All the data is transferred in encrypted
form.
