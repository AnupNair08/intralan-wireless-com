# IntraLAN-Wireless-Com
Software Engineering Mini Project: Communication and Data Sharing within LAN
IntraLAN Wireless Com is a communication and data sharing application that can be used for effective communuication over local area networks without having to route data via the public internet. This serves significant benefits in comparison to traditional networking in the form of speed, security and connectivity, The solution is a cross platform client that can be used across devices and operating systems in an easy and convenient manner.

### Project Structure
- `native-app/` Contains the source code for the android and iOS clients. The directory contains the javascript code in React Native and the android build for the same.
- `intralan-web/` Contains the web client written in React

### Using the mobile version

#### Prerequistes
- Android SDK v28 installed
- ndk bundle <a href="https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r21b-linux-x86_64.zip">Download from here</a>
- Extract and copy the downloaded ndk files to the /home/user/Android/Sdk/ndk folder


#### Steps
- Start by cloning the repository.
- Since React Native does not run in a nodejs environment, an external package for using nodejs and hence the HTTP server for broadcasting is used by the application.
- Once cloned, navigate to the `native-app` directory.
- Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
- Navigate to `nodejs-assets/nodejs-project` and run `npm i` to install the dependencies for the nodejs package for React Native.
- Go back to the `native-app/` directory and make a file called `local.properties` and add the following lines to it:
```
sdk.dir=/home/<user>/Android/Sdk
ndk.dir=/home/<user>/Android/Sdk/ndk/android-ndk-r21b


Replace the <user> with your username
```
- Next step is to copy the files in the `native-app/dependency` directory to the `native-app/node_modules/nodejs-mobile-react-native/android/` directory. Replace the src folder with the one from dependency.
- Once all this is done, go to the `native-app/android/` folder and run the following:
```
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew clean
```
- Connect your phone via USB to the computer and make sure that USB debugging is enabled. Verify that the device is connected using `adb devices` command in the terminal.
- Run `npx react-native run-android` with the phone connected. This should start building the application
- Open another terminal and run `react-native start` to fire the development server.
- Once the build is completed, the application should be installed on your device.
- Open the app and shake your device to open the developer settings. Alternately you can also press d on the terminal to start it. Go to settings -> debug server host & port -> and add your laptops ip followed by port number. Eg: 192.168.1.20:8081
- The application can now be hot reloaded and the changes will be built and sent over the network. 

### Updates and Progress
Implemented the calling and file sharing features. The messaging and web client are in works now. 
It takes some time to connect to call....please be patient for a while when you initiate call/transfer files....
